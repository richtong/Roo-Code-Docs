# Dashboard

The Roo Code Cloud dashboard provides a central location to manage your account, view task history, monitor usage analytics, and control remote workspaces.

## Accessing the Dashboard

There are two ways to access your Roo Code Cloud dashboard:

### Method 1: From the Roo Code Plugin

Once logged in, click the **cloud icon** <Codicon name="cloud" /> in the top right corner of the Roo Code plugin, then click **Visit Roo Code Cloud**.

### Method 2: Direct Web Access

Navigate directly to the Roo Code Cloud web application:

**https://app.roocode.com/**

This allows you to access your dashboard from any web browser, even when not using the Roo Code extension.

## Dashboard Pages

### Home Page

The Home page combines Roomote Control and Tasks History in a single view.

#### Roomote Control Section
The [Roomote Control](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control) section at the top allows you to:
- **Toggle Roomote Control (Pro)** — Visible only when subscribed to Roo Code Cloud Pro; enable/disable remote control from the top right. See [Billing & Subscriptions](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions#pro-plan-20month).
- **View Connected Workspaces** — Shows your active VS Code workspace(s) with connection status
- **Start New Tasks (Pro)** — Use the "New Task" button to launch tasks remotely

#### Tasks Section
- **Toggle Task Sync** — Enable/disable monitoring for live updates from your IDE

Use Task Sync to stream live updates and review task history; columns are self-explanatory.

### Usage Analytics Page

Access detailed usage metrics by clicking the **Usage** tab in the navigation bar or navigate directly to [app.roocode.com/usage](https://app.roocode.com/usage).
