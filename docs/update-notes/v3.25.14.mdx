# Roo Code 3.25.14 Release Notes (2025-08-13)

This release fixes critical issues with AWS Bedrock 1M context support, OpenAI model switching, and improves the development environment.

## Bug Fixes

* **AWS Bedrock 1M Context**: Fixed parameter placement for Claude Sonnet 4 models to properly enable 1M context window support ([#7056](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7056))
* **OpenAI Model Switching**: Fixed API errors when switching from GPT-5 models to GPT-4.1 or other models that don't support the verbosity parameter (thanks eastonmeth!) ([#7055](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7055))
* **Development Environment**: Fixed webview functionality in development mode ([#7044](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7044))
* **Token Usage Reporting**: Reverted previous changes to prioritize user experience by allowing request interruption over precise cost reporting ([#7039](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7039))

## Internal Improvements

* **Code Organization**: Moved cloud-related types from @roo-code/types to dedicated @roo-code/cloud package ([#7038](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7038))
