# Roo Code 3.25.18 Release Notes (2025-08-19)

Update to Roo Code 3.25.18 to access Sonic — a stealth model from a major AI provider — with a massive 262,144‑token context and FREE 72‑hour access. This release also includes provider enhancements and reliability fixes.

## Sonic (Stealth Model)

Sonic is now available in Roo Code ([#7207](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7207)) ([#7212](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7212)) ([#7218](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7218))  — a stealth model from a major AI provider designed for long‑range, context‑rich work:

- 262,144‑token context lets you work across very large codebases, logs, and transcripts in one session.
- FREE for 72 hours so you can try Sonic with real tasks.

> Important: Sonic is delivered via Roo Code Cloud. To get this model to work, you must connect your IDE to Roo Code Cloud. See [Roo Code Cloud sign in](/roo-code-cloud/login).

## Bug Fixes

- LM Studio models: prevents duplicate entries (case‑insensitive) (thanks fbuechler!) ([#7185](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7185))
- Reasoning usage: respects enableReasoningEffort setting, avoiding unintended reasoning costs (thanks ikbencasdoei!) ([#7049](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7049))

## Documentation Updates

- ask_followup_question: simplifies the prompt guidance for clearer authoring ([#7191](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7191)) — see [ask_followup_question tool](/advanced-usage/available-tools/ask-followup-question).
